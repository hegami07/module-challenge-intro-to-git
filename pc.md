## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development 
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? Git is intalled and maintained on your local computer (rather than in a cloud), while GitHub is designed as a Git repository hosting service.
3. Why do we create a branch? When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout 
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. The git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. git pull is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content
7. What is a merge conflict? Merge conflicts happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes. After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content. The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command. Git will create a new merge commit to finalize the merge.
